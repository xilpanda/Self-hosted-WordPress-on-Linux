## Project Overview

This project involves advanced configuration and optimization of Nginx and PHP-FPM specifically tailored for a WordPress environment. The following configurations and enhancements were implemented:

### Nginx Configuration Expertise (`nginx.conf`):

- **Optimized Performance:** Configured Nginx to operate under `www-data` with dynamic worker processes based on CPU cores, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** Allowed up to 1024 connections per worker process to improve server scalability.
- **Efficient Server Management:** Streamlined HTTP settings, including MIME types and error logging, to simplify server management.
- **Strengthened Security:** Enforced TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols, and disabled SSLv3 to protect against vulnerabilities like POODLE.
- **Improved Script Processing:** Boosted performance by enabling Gzip compression and configuring FastCGI caching.

### WordPress-Specific Nginx Configuration (`wordpress_nginx.conf`):

- **Architected Server Block:** Designed the server block for WordPress, managing traffic on port 80 for efficient content delivery.
- **Optimized PHP Handling:** Implemented advanced FastCGI caching controls, excluding critical paths such as admin and WooCommerce, to maintain site integrity.
- **Enhanced Load Times:** Enabled long-term caching for static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images), significantly reducing page load times.

### PHP-FPM Optimization for WordPress (`wordpress_phpfpm.conf`):

- **Custom PHP-FPM Pool:** Designed a tailored PHP-FPM pool using Unix sockets for communication, with dynamic process management for handling varying loads efficiently.
- **Fine-Tuned Settings:** Configured PHP-FPM with a 25MB file upload limit and robust error logging, ensuring reliable and consistent site performance.
