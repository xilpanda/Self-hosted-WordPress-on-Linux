# Managing Services with systemd

When operating as the root user (or if you've switched to root using sudo -i or su - root), you can run these commands without prefixing them with sudo, though including it won't cause any issues.

## Start your services (and enable them at boot)

```
sudo systemctl start nginx php8.3-fpm monit
sudo systemctl enable mysql nginx php8.3-fpm monit
```
